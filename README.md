# The Piano App User Notes

## What is it?

My first App, built using React.
___

## What does it do?

A small game to help people learn where the notes are on a Piano/Keyboard.

___

The main front end component is a series of HTML buttons, laid out using CSS to mimic the 12 keys in a piano's octave. The original design [came from here](https://codepen.io/clkent/pen/dQwGqj)

___

* Random note is generated from Array of possible notes in randomNoteGenerator.

* If user clicks correct note score is incremented and displayed at the bottom of the screen.

## Plans for the future

Eventually the app will have a simple back end that links to a database of user information. Front end plans include a login screen (for use with the back end), hints if you hit the wrong note 3 times, a timed mode and eventually different scales and possibly chords.
